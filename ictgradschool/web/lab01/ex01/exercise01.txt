        <h1>This is a HUGE heading</h1>
        <h2>This is still a Big heading</h2>
        <h3>This heading still stands out</h3>

        <p>
            This is a paragraph.<br /> The line break forces a new line.</p>
        <p>
            Other headings include: h4, h5 and h6 which by default are incrementally smaller.
            <br />
            Use the heading tags for structuring your text content into sections under their own headings.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <p>
            This is yet another paragraph, which follows after a horizontal rule. Use horizontal rules to add some separation between text if you need it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next word is <b>bold</b> and so is <strong>this</strong> one usually.
        </p>
        <p>
            This next word however is in <i>italics</i>, and usually so is <em>this</em> one.
